Preferrably, don't.
I'm not saying you can't, I'm saying you shouldn't.
The code itself is a flaming mess, and, probably, it will remain in that state.

However, if you are willing to contribute for some reason particular reason,
be it your will to fix the code or fix a typo in the readme or something else,
