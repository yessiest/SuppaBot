# Suppa Bot: a bot that exists for some reason

Welcome.
You have reached that point in life where you're about to witness true horror.
There is nothing stopping you from leaving.

However,
if you decide to stay just to witness the marvellous wonders of overengineering and bad ideas,
then you're at the right place.

## Installation

## Wiki

There is no wiki, not yet at the very least.
Would be neat though.

I'm not saying you can't, im saying you shouldn't.
Sincerely, the human error that created this bot.
